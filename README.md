# CSPhome

An interpreter for a human-readable CSP language. Syntax closely mirrors mathematical notation. Written in Go, which alreafy uses a CSP-like model for concurrency, ideally reducing the complexity in creating this 'pure' implementation.

A component towards my final year project at the University of Bath, studying the divcergence between computational concurrency theory and practical paradigms found in modern code.
