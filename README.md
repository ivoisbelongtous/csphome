# CSPhome

An interpreter for a human-readable CSP language. Syntax closely mirrors mathematical notation. Written in Go, which already uses a CSP-like model for concurrency, ideally reducing the complexity in creating this 'pure' implementation.

A component towards my final year project at the University of Bath, studying the divergence between computational concurrency theory and practical paradigms found in modern code.

## Building

Assuming a valid Go installation, simply run ```go generate```, ```go install```, then ```csphome```.
